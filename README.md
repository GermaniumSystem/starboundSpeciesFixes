# Starbound Species Fixes

This is a set of scripts and templates designed to built one massive mod to hotfix all species mods affected by the 1.3 update.
It does this by downloading all mods in the Starbound workshop (`getModIDs.sh` and `getMods.sh`) and then building fixes for every broken captain's chair and mech-less species (`patchv2.sh`).
All fixes are as non-invasive as possible and shouldn't cause issues if a mod author returns and provides their own fixes.
